- Document or automate the use of clasp commands to push GroupAvail files into developer's Apps Script environment
- Add a user configurable feature toggle for the treatment of unaccepted calendar invitations (i.e. follow free busy conventions)
- Honor working hours for calendar searches (not currently available to use from the Calendar APIs at the time of writing)
